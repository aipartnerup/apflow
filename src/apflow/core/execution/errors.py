"""
Custom exceptions for task execution.

This module defines exceptions that represent different failure modes
during task execution, following best practices from FastAPI and other
production frameworks.

Exception Hierarchy:
    ApflowError (base)
        ├── BusinessError (user/expected errors, no stack trace)
        │   ├── ValidationError (input validation failures)
        │   ├── ConfigurationError (config/environment issues)
        │   ├── NetworkError (network/connection failures)
        │   └── AuthenticationError (auth failures)
        └── SystemError (unexpected errors, with stack trace)
            ├── ExecutorError (executor runtime failures)
            └── StorageError (database/storage failures)

Usage Guidelines:
    - Raise BusinessError subclasses for expected failures (bad input, missing config)
    - Use structured error format: what/why/how_to_fix/context
    - Let system exceptions (TimeoutError, ConnectionError) propagate naturally
    - TaskManager logs BusinessError without exc_info, others with exc_info

Structured Error Format:
    All error classes support optional structured information:
    - what: What went wrong (brief description)
    - why: Why it happened (root cause)
    - how_to_fix: How to resolve it (actionable steps)
    - context: Additional context (dict with relevant details)

class BusinessError(ApflowError):
    """
    Base exception for expected/user-facing failures.

    Use this exception for:
    - Validation errors (invalid input, missing required fields)
    - Configuration errors (missing API keys, invalid settings)
    - Permission errors (unauthorized access, quota exceeded)
    - Resource errors (file not found, resource unavailable)

    These errors represent expected failure modes that don't require
    stack traces for debugging. The TaskManager will log them without
    exc_info=True to keep logs clean.

    For unexpected system errors (network failures, timeouts, service errors),
    let the original exception propagate so it includes a full stack trace.

    Example:
        >>> if not inputs.get("api_key"):
        >>>     raise ConfigurationError("API key is required")

class ValidationError(BusinessError):

    Validation-specific business error.

        >>>     raise ValidationError("model is required in inputs")

class ConfigurationError(BusinessError):

class NetworkError(BusinessError):

    Network or connection-related business error.

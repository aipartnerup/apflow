# apflow

**Distributed Task Orchestration Framework**

Start standalone in 30 seconds with DuckDB. Scale to distributed clusters with PostgreSQL -- no code changes required.

---

## Deployment Modes

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   __Standalone__

    ---

    Single process, DuckDB storage, zero configuration.
    Ideal for development, testing, and small-scale automation.

    ```bash
    pip install apflow
    ```

    [Quick Start](getting-started/quick-start.md){ .md-button }

-   __Distributed Cluster__{ .lg .middle }

    ---

    PostgreSQL-backed, leader/worker topology with automatic leader election, task leasing, and horizontal scaling. Add worker nodes at any time.

    ```bash
    pip install apflow[standard]
    ```

    [Cluster Guide](guides/distributed-cluster.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

</div>

!!! tip "Same application code in both modes"
    Write your tasks once. Switch from standalone to distributed by changing only the runtime configuration -- set `APFLOW_CLUSTER_ENABLED=true` and point to PostgreSQL.

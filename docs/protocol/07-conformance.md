## Conformance Levels

Requirements are categorized using RFC 2119 keywords:

- `createTask`

### Streaming Support

**SHOULD**: Implementations SHOULD support at least one streaming mode (SSE, WebSocket, or push notifications).

**SHOULD**: Implementations SHOULD provide real-time progress updates during task execution.

### Input Validation

**SHOULD**: Implementations SHOULD validate `inputs` against `schemas.input_schema` before execution.

**SHOULD**: Implementations SHOULD provide clear error messages for validation failures.
